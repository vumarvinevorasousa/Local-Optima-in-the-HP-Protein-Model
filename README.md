This github page contains the files with the code written for the Master Thesis:

"Local Optima Within the HP-Protein Model and What This Means For Alzheimer's Disease" by Marvin Ã‰vora Sousa.

The files simple_hill.py and simple_hill_3D.py are responsible for performing the hill climber runs and generating all the conformations.
plot_stat.py plots the average number of accepted mutations and stability for a given protein.
get_best.py produces the stability distributions of the protein and also visualizes each final protein conformation through fold_graph.py and fold_graph_3D.py.
gen_progress.py creates the figures for the generational progress (including the function to compare two stability values)
